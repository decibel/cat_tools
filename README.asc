== Cat Tools
These are tools that make it easier to interface with the Postgres catalog
tables/views/functions. They are meant for use by code, not by people.

To make use of them, you need to grant `cat_tools__usage` to any roles that need access.

== Current Status

This is very much a work in progress. If it doesn't do something you need, please https://github.com/decibel/cat_tools/issues[open an issue]!
