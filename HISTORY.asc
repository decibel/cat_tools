=## BUGFIX: Drop pg_temp objects created by extension

It was not possible to actually install 0.1.2 and 0.1.1 because they left
temporary objects behind. During session cleanup, the cascade drop of those
objects would cascede to the extension itself.

0.1.2
-----
=## BUGFIX: Install upgrade script

0.1.1

=## Add cat_tools__usage role

Previously, granting permissions to use these tools was difficult. Now all you
need to do is grant cat_tools__usage to roles that you would like to have
access to these tools. Keep in mind they are not meant for use by people, only
by code.
